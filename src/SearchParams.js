  // How to handle asynchronous code inside of React

  // useEffect is gonna take place of several life cycle hooks.
  // Disconnected from rendering. Schedules a function to run after the render happens
  // Render the first time, schedule useEffect to run, but then render before
  // anything inside useEffect runs. This mean you don't slowdown that first render,
  // so the user sees something immediately.
  // Second argument is an array of things that this depends on, i.e., only run
  // the function if these things change. Set to empty array to have it run only once.

    // Initialize
    setBreeds([]);

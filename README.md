# fm-adoptme5

Adopt Me is a pet finder app written in React.

I built this application while taking this course on
[Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/): [Complete Into to React, v5](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/)

Working on getting this app live. Having trouble with deploying Parcel bundles on Github pages.
